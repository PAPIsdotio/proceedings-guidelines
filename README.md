# Guidelines for PAPIs conference proceedings

## General guidelines

Proceedings of PAPIs conferences are published in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (the conference proceedings journal of JMLR), so please prepare a paper at a standard suitable for PMLR/JMLR. General guidelines for the scope, content and originality of papers in JMLR are available [here](http://www.jmlr.org/author-info.html), however the submission procedure will differ slightly for the proceedings.

We are accepting different types of paper, including industrial experience reports, research papers, technical reports and review papers.

Some examples of accepted papers from previous years are:

* [Azure ML, 2015](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v50/azureml15.pdf) (Industrial experience report)
* [Li, 2016](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/li17a/li17a.pdf) (Industrial experience report)
* [Gutierrez, 2016](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/gutierrez17a/gutierrez17a.pdf) (Research paper)
* [Cetinsoy, 2015](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v50/cetinsoy15.pdf) (Review paper)

Submitted papers should be 4-8 pages in length (not including bibliography).

## Format

The format of the paper submissions has been adapted from the standard JMLR submission format described in [`jmlr2e.sty`](https://github.com/PAPIsdotio/proceedings-guidelines/blob/master/jmlr2e.sty) with a couple of changes:

- The title of the journal has been changed to Proceedings of Machine Learning Research
- The references to Submission and Publication dates have been removed from the header: \jmlrheading{1}{2000}{1-48}{author list}

The style and sample files are available in this repository.

Other than these changes, you can follow the formatting instructions [here](http://www.jmlr.org/format/format.html).

The first submission can be submitted as a PDF document, but we will request that the final submission is made as a single LaTeX .tex document (and any accompanying figures).

Accepted papers will be provided with a starting page number and volume number for PMLR before our proceedings are submitted to Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

## Release

Please return the [release form](https://github.com/PAPIsdotio/proceedings-guidelines/blob/master/release.pdf) with your submission.

# Guidelines for PAPIs conference proceedings

## General guidelines

Proceedings of PAPIs conferences are published in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (the conference proceedings journal of JMLR), so please prepare a paper at a standard suitable for PMLR/JMLR. General guidelines for the scope, content and originality of papers in JMLR are available [here](http://www.jmlr.org/author-info.html), however the submission procedure will differ slightly for the proceedings.

We are accepting different types of paper, including industrial experience reports, research papers, technical reports and review papers. Some examples of accepted papers from previous years are:

* [Azure ML, 2015](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v50/azureml15.pdf) (Industrial experience report)

\documentclass[pmlr]{jmlr}

Full details of the jmlr class and sample files can be found here:

https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/jmlr?lang=en

Authors should format use the sample file jmlrwcp-sample.tex (included here) as
a guideline for formatting their article. The jmlr.cls file is also included
for your convenience.

The style and sample files are available in this repository. Detailed information about the jmlr class is available in jmlr.pdf.

The first submission can be submitted as a PDF document, but we will request that the final submission is made as a single LaTeX `.tex` document (and any accompanying figures).

Accepted papers will be provided with a starting page number and volume number for PMLR before our proceedings are submitted to Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

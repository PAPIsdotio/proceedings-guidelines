## General guidelines

PAPIs '17 Proceedings will be published in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (the conference proceedings journal of JMLR), so please prepare a paper at a standard suitable for JMLR. General guidelines for the scope, content and originality of papers in JMLR are available here: http://www.jmlr.org/author-info.html, however the submission procedure will differ slightly for the proceedings.

We are accepting three types of paper, including industrial experience reports, research papers, technical reports and review papers.

Some examples of accepted papers from previous years are:

* Azure ML, 2015 (Industrial experience report), http://proceedings.mlr.press/v50/azureml15.pdf

## Format

The format of the paper submissions has been adapted from the standard JMLR submission format described in jmlr2e.sty with a couple of changes:

- The title of the journal has been changed to Proceedings of Machine Learning Research
- The references to Submission and Publication dates have been removed from the heade: \jmlrheading{1}{2000}{1-48}{author list}

The the style and sample files are available here:

https://github.com/archgroove/proceedings-papis-guidelines

Other than these changes, you can follow the formatting instructions at http://www.jmlr.org/format/format.html.

The first submission due 10 November 2017 can be submitted as a PDF document, but we will request that the final submission is made as a single LaTeX .tex document (and any accompanying figures).

Accepted papers will be provided with a starting page number and volume number for PMLR before our proceedings are submitted to Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.
